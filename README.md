# Welcome.

This is a perl script written by me for the primary purpose of running a ddos attack on the victim.

This is made for educational purposes and I am not responsible for any malicious actions that are committed with this. 

To use it, download ex.pl and get download perl from https://www.perl.org (if its not already installed on your machine)

After, run

perl ex.pl (IP) (PORT) (SIZE) (TIME)

Example : perl ex.pl 1.1.1.1 80 65500 1200

This example command will run a 1200 second attack on target 1.1.1.1 on port 80 with a 65500 byte attack.
